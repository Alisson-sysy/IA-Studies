## Configure local ambiente

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a virtual environment for Python:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment using the cd command. For example:

    `cd path/to/your/directory`

3. Once you're in the desired directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment named "myenv" (you can replace "myenv" with any name you prefer):

    `python -m venv myenv`

4. After running the command, you'll notice a new directory named "myenv" (or the name you chose) created in your current directory. This directory contains the Python interpreter and a copy of the standard Python library.

5. To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your operating system:

- On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
- On macOS and Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`

6. Once activated, you'll notice that the command prompt changes, indicating that you're now working within the virtual environment.

7. Now, you can install packages and work on your Python projects within this isolated environment without affecting your system-wide Python installation.

8. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your system's default Python environment, simply run the following command:
`deactivate`

# Project 1 - Perceptron

The initial project involves a basic perceptron algorithm designed to solve OR/AND logic problems. To evaluate the code, execute the .py file, select a training method for the algorithm to follow, and then input the values to be checked.
